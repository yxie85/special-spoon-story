Once upon a time, there was a girl living in a small village with her bunny.

Every year the her village had a bunny race, but after looking all over for her
fuffy he was no where to be found. She checked fluffy's normal hangout spots, in the long grass behind the boat house, on the shore line where the children play
and even in the garden! Fluffy was gone!
