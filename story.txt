Once upon a time, there was a girl living in a small village with her bunny.

Every year the her village had a bunny race, but after looking all over for her
fuffy he was no where to be found. She checked fluffy's normal hangout spots, in the long grass behind the boat house, on the shore line where the children play
and even in the garden! Fluffy was gone! 

After hours of searching, the girl decided to take a different approach. She set out a small bed of pillows and blankets in hope that fluffy would come back home to take a nap.
To top it all off she even put some carrots out knowing that fluffy would be hungry.

Luckily, fluffy was hungry and came to carrots. After the meal, fluffy attended the race and won the first place!
